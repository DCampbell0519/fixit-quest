## Description:
As you get older, do you find it increasingly difficult to manage your to-do's effectively?  Is your regrigerator littered with the remnants of half completed to-do lists, with seemingly no method to the madness?  Well look no further!  Fixit Quest is a fun and interactive app that allows you to handle all of your general maintenance tasks and to-do's. Whether for your home, vehicle, or otherwise, create tasks and organize by category, view stats, check off completed tasks, make notes to refer to later, and level up as you do!

## Getting Started:
- Clone the repo to your local repository.
- Set up virtual environment (pipenv shell)
- Install dependencies (pipenv install)
- Run database migrations (python3 manage.py migrate)
- Create a superuser (python3 manage createsuperuser)
- Start the development server (python3 manage.py runserver)
- Server will run on http://localhost:8000

## Technologies Used:
- Django
- Python3
- HTML
- CSS
- PostgreSQL
- Tailwind/DaisyUI
- Heroku

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Django/Python
- Frontend: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
- Database: PostgreSQL (via psycopg2)
- Deployment: Heroku
- Templating: Django Templates
- Authentication: Django built-in User/Auth system

## Stretch Goals:
- Create a dynamic XP bar to render on the User's profile page, as a visual representation of when the user is about to level up.
- Create a badge system for various milestones.  i.e. X tasks completed, Reach a certain level, etc.  As well as a page for the user to view their accomplishments.
- Create a more robust "stats tracking" feature.  i.e. Total tasks completed, most active category, average length of time for task completion, etc.
- Add the ability to upload multiple images to tasks, home or vehicle.
